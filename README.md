Internship Social Network Analysis
==================================

November 2012 - March 2013
--------------------------

Social Network is structure that represents social connections of an individual, an organization, or even a group and the way these are connected to each other. Social Network perspective provides a way of analyzing the social network as a social entity, this process of analyzing social network for identifying local and global patterns; the key influencer and network dynamics is called “Social Network Analysis”.

A social network can be represented using graph called a social graph containing nodes and links, representing relationship that a person has in his social network. It has been referred to as "the global mapping of everybody and how they are related". The concept of the social graph is not a new thing, and it is not unique to social media. But what social networks do provide is a systematized way of storing these objects and these connections.

Social Graph can be identified with the following major purpose:-
1) Identify the key individual (Key Influencer's)
2) Shortest path between two individual
3) Measures of centrality

The project module is to develop a web interface for viewing the social graph and to perform processing and analysis on graph using Giraph. The module is being developed using Hadoop, Apache Giraph, Apache Hive, D3.js, Json, javascript and php. The interface and the graph will be based on processing of the telecommunication based call record data, bank data and email data. The various log details will further be processed to give a full-fledged graph. The graph will highlight the major and the minor nodes and their dependencies to each other in form of edges. The closely related nodes will form as community hence distributing the graph into various closely related clusters.

The graph can be visualized on the web interface once the selected log is uploaded. Using the discrete options available on the interface design operations can be performed on the loaded graph. The calculative algorithms will operate on the respective logs to extract necessary details about the connected graph and represent the derived information further on to the browser.
